              Hello!
              I'm Sofia, a software developer with a 12-year background in healthcare, having worked previously as a nurse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up surrounded by MS-DOS and command lines, programming has always been a part of my life - anything from loading my favourite games through MS-DOS when I was 5 years old
              to adding sparkly widgets with HTML and CSS to my blog when I was a teenager -
              so transitioning from nursing to software development was just a natural step for me, driven by my passion of problem-solving and making peopleâ€™s lives easier through software.
            </p>
            <p>This transition from healthcare allows me to seamlessly integrate skills honed from my previous career on my approach to software development and project leadership.</p>
            <p>On my free time, I'm also an avid VR games player. :)</p>
